            <p>My name is Kallum, I'm 16 and I attend EKC Dover College as a</p> 
            <p>student/class rep in the computing course. Some of my</p> 
            <p>hobbies include going on long walks, spending time with</p>
            <p>people/pets, gaming and problem solving and listening to music.</p>
            <p>I've enjoyed going on long walks since I started secondary school, as it helped calm my mind after a hard day. I enjoy spending time with my pets as they brighten my mood.</p>
